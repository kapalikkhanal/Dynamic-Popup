# Dynamic Popup

This README will guide you through setting up and running the project, as well as provide an overview of the codebase and its functionalities.

Create a popup? [https://dynamicpopup.vercel.app/](https://dynamicpopup.vercel.app/)

## Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kapalikkhanal/dynamic-popup.git
cd dynamic-popup
```

Once the project has been cloned, run these commands to install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once the project starts correctly, you can add headings, body text, and footer text to start creating a popup. You can drag and drop the texts to position them as you like. The tools available allow you to customize the background color, text color, text alignments, image position, and more. Also you can download the popup image. You can also select the popup frequency, such as displaying it only once, repeatedly, or on reload.

## Supabase Database Setup
We are using Supabase to store the popup data. Follow these steps to set up Supabase:

- Go to [supabase.com]([https://kapalik.com](https://supabase.com/dashboard/projects)) and create a new project.
- Set up a table in your Supabase project.
- Run the SQL Query to Generate a Table
  
Use the following SQL query to create the Dynamic Popup table in your Supabase database:
```bash
create table
  public."Dynamic Popup" (
    id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
    heading text null,
    "bodyText" text null,
    "footerText" text null,
    "previewImage" text null,
    frequency character varying null,
    "timeFrequency" character varying null,
    popup boolean null,
    "onDay" character varying null,
    "isActive" boolean null,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    uuid character varying null,
    constraint Dynamic Popup_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```
Once it has been set up, copy your Supabase Key and Supabase URL to api/popup.js in order to setup the supabase connection.

## API Endpoints

### GET Request

The backend is built using Next.js. After cloning the repository, you can make a GET request to fetch the popup data using the following URL:

```bash
http://localhost:{port}/api/popup
```

This link will provide you with the JSON data of the response.

### PUT Request

To update the popup status, you can make a PUT request to the following URL:

```bash
http://localhost:{port}/api/popup
```

### Body Payload

```json
{
  "uuid": "Your pop-up uuid",
  "popup": true or false
}
```
